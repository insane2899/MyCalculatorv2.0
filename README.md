# MyCalculatorv2.0
This is an android calculator 
The special part of this project is the fact that it uses Postfix to calculate the input expression. The project is done on Android Studio ide using Java.

On Launching the application, at first this will come:

![Launch](https://github.com/insane2899/MyCalculatorv2.0/blob/master/images/Start.png?raw=true title="Launching")

Then we can enter the data by typing the numbers. We can use any of the symbols present as long as they are used properly(mismatched brackets will give an error and output will be 'SYNTAX ERROR').

Finally when we press the equals button the calculator shows the result. We can use the result to calculate furthur.

This application has a few bugs as it crashes when it is used for a long time (If more than 1000 calculations are done then the stacks get filled as a result the apps starts slowing down and crashing). Also there are some improvements that i would like to bring (Like changing base of numbers, ability to revisit previous calculations, a few more symbols like the log, the square root and the ability to calculate very large numbers (greater than 10^18)). I will be updating this project regularly in future.
